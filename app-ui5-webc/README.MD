## Install and Building the app

First install all dependencies for this app:

```bash
npm install
```

Afterwards you can build the app (including the necessary OpenUI5 and web-component sources) with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you make changes to the app sources only, you can also re-build just the app like this:

```bash
npm run build-app
```

## Serving the app

Start a local server and run the app:

```bash
npm run serve-dist
```
