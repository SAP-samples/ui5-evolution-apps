## Install and Build the app

First, install all dependencies for this app:

```bash
npm install
```

Afterwards, you can build the app (including the necessary OpenUI5 sources) with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you make changes to the app sources only, you can also re-build just the app like this:

```bash
npm run build-app
```

## Serve and Run the app

Start a local web server and run the app in your browser:

```bash
npm run serve-dist
```
